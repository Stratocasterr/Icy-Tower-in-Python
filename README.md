# Icy-Tower-in-Python


This project, which I created with my college friends, is our version of popular Icy-Tower game using python's "pygame" library.
    In this game, we control a player, which is jumping on platforms in order to get on how category elevation floor composed of various segments referring to the style of buildings of the Warsaw University of Technology. With the height of the platforms, they get smaller and smaller, what more is needed concentration and skill of dexterity. The camera gets faster with time in the above-mentioned. It can also bounce off the walls to target share points action.
